Do not stay here.', u"Had this hotel not been pre booked (cancellation window passed) we would have walked to one of the neighboring hotels after smelling our room's sour moisture aroma.\nMy first concern was watching someone in front of us check in without reservation or credit card. Indicator they don't hold their own property in high regard.\nAt first glance the room seemed...\n\n\nMore", u"Where to begin...\nThe purpose of the trip was a last minute football venture where a friend of mine and I drove from Toronto to Pittsburgh for the evening.\nWe used hotels.com to book, which will be the last time using that website, and let's just say, you definitely pay for what you get, and get scammed while you're doing...\n\n\nMore", u'My husband\'s sister passed away suddenly and we were looking for a reasonable motel to stay in close to the airport. When we got into our room it was hot and stuffy. The carpet is covered in stains, appears to be black grease. Black paint was also splattered on the wall near the "air conditioner" which I use the words...\n\n\nMore', u'I stayed at this hotel while on my way home from Philadelphia, just to sleep for the night before finishing our drive home. The inn is more of a motel where each room has a door leading out to the parking lot and its own box air conditioner in the window. Upon first entering the room, we noticed a strange,...\n\n\nMore', u'We arrived at this dive at 3am. They made us pay for the room as soon as we arrived instead of the usual payment at checkout. Right then I knew something was up. Checkout is 11am, keep in mind that we are the only car in the lot and only couple staying in this motel. We traveled over 6 hours...\n\n\nMore', u'I\'ve remained neutral in any hotel I\'ve ever stayed. This one took the cake.I pulled up to this "hotel". Very bare (for lack of a better word) and hidden from any signs of life.(It was next to another hotel and a huge corporation and just parking lots). I usually like to grab something to eat near a hotel I\'m staying......\n\n\nMore', u"The staff at this hotel act like you are bothering them when you interact with them in any way from checking in, to asking questions, to checking out. The rooms themselves are horrible, many items in the rooms are either poorly repaired or altogether broken. the first room they assigned us to, the lights over the sink didn't work and...\n\n\nMore", u'Don\'t beleive the "free breakfast"; a trip advisor post warned me it would be just white toast and reconstituted orange juice, but when I went the toaster was broken and they wee out of OJ. No glassware in the room; ever try to make hot coffee in a styrofoam cup? And the slowest wifi I have ever encountered; reminded me...\n\n\nMore', u'I went to stay there with my family and had one if the worst experiences there. The staff are not friendly and one of the staff guys accused us of stealing their towels ( in broken English with an accent ).\nThe lady at the main lobby kept spying on us when we went to have breakfast.\nThe rooms are...\n\n\nMore'], 'img_url': u'http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/7b/97/0e/guest-room.jpg'}

However, when I come to the front desk I do expect to be treated professionally. The girl at the front desk was face timing her friends who were swearing and talking about their evening plans. After I checked in I turned around to see that some...\n\n\nMore", u"We stayed 3 nights there recently. Having asked for a quiet room in my reservation I was given the room right off the lobby with the central stairwell just behind our bed. We checked in late and I was tired so didn't change figuring things would quiet down. The front desk noise did around 11pm, but people were banging on...\n\n\nMore", u'Showers were hot, room was clean, staff was nice. Close proximity to Allegheny General Hospital (about 20 minutes). This hotel was significantly cheaper than others in the area. Would definitely stay again.', u'We stayed at this Motel 6 last weekend. There was no question about where to stay since we stayed there in December 2014 for a family affair. It is a nice place, is pet friendly, has a nice location and is economical. Recommend it for staying and visiting the city.', u"A real DUMP.. Ceiling dripped on the bed and on the floor. Toilet ran every 10 minutes all night long. All ice machines broken.. Hand held shower didn't fit the clip and ran all over the bathroom floor. Doors banged all night long. Shady characters outside our window most of the night. A/C noisy off and on all night. Heard...\n\n\nMore", u'We had stayed here previously when it was the Comfort Inn, about 3 years ago. Not a high-polish, high-end place, but no notable problems with it. The going rate is $60 (the cheapest price is accessed direct through their site) and noticed you can get another 10% off if you are AARP. If the front parking lot is filled there...\n\n\nMore', u'This hotel should not offer non-smoking rooms if they aren\'t available. Our "non-smoking" room required us to walk through a very smelly smoking hallway (tobacco and *other*). When we got to our room, there were two ash trays by the beds and one in the bathroom. A call to the front desk and we were told that our room was...\n\n\nMore', u'Stayed for two nights while in town for a Steelers game. Got a great rate but the room was to be non-smoking and the smell hit you as you walked in the door. I called to change but got the "were full" line. Opened window, washed a/ c screens in the bathtub and lite a candle. Few hours later it...\n\n\nMore', u'This motel 6 was filthy and poorly maintained. upon arriving to our room we found it was in the smoking section when we specifically requested nonsmoking, and they were unwilling to change us to a nonsmoking room because they were booked. The room was visibly dirty with an unswept carpet, dirty mirror, smudges on the furniture and window and even...\n\n\nMore', u"This facility became a Motel 6 only about a year ago. So you can understand why it doesn't look like the typical shabby Motel 6 and why it offers much more comfort. We found the rooms to be sizeable, the bathroom to work well (as another reviewer mentioned, they don't provide shampoo - so bring your own), the television and...\n\n\nMore"], 'img_url': u'http://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif'}
